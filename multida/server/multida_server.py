#
# This app creates the main server socket and spawns a connection handling
# thread for each connected peer. The connection thread is then responsible
# for validating the user and determining what module to instantiate to handle
# the connection. The module handler registers the connection in the global
# 'connections' list and processes all client requests from that point on.

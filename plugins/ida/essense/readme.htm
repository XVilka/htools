<h3>What is it?</h3>
Essense is <a href="http://www.idapro.com">IDA Pro</a> 
(<a href="http://www.idapro.ru">Russian</a>) plugin.
It's main purpose is to save essense of IDA database to XML-storage.
It's like <b>Dump database to IDC</b> IDA command, but with some difference:
essense is function-based (by default, plugin will save only user-modified 
functions). Next, plugin is like IDA signatures - try to save only 'valuable'
instruction length, so essense is become position and file independent.<br>
This can be useful, if you analysed some version of file and now try to 
load newer version. Or you analyse several files, which use same library/API.
You can just save selected function from current database to XML-file (essense) 
and then just find and load them in new database.You will load almost everything:
<ul>
<li>Structures used in this function
 </li>
<li>Enums used in this function
 </li>
<li>Frame of function
 </li>
<li>Names, comments, etc...
 </li>
</ul>
Also, you will see a lot of bugs, of coz! :-)

<a name="usage"></a>
<h3>Usage</h3>
You can load the plugin by pressing (by default) "Alt-1". Choose requred action
(Save or Load).
Plugin options:
<ul>
<li>Start Address - start address for operation
 </li>
<li>End Address - end address for operation
 </li>
<li>Filename - file name for operation
 </li>
<li>Show debug info - show some unuseful info :-)
 </li>
<li>Ignore CALL TO<br>
To recognize function like
<pre>func_x:<br>call func_y<br>ret<br></pre>
plugin have to store name of <b>func_y</b> and check it while loading.
To turn off this option, check this flag. But be ready to edit/delete some
small functions from XML-file or you have a lot of wrong-recognized functions
in new database.<br>
On other side - sometimes you have to run plugin several times to have function
<b>func_y</b> recognized, before function <b>func_x</b> will be recognized.
 </li>
<li>Don't check names of functions - save all functions, not just user-named.<br>
Be careful - this will grow a lot you XML file!
 </li>
<li>All functions - save all functions, detected by IDA.<br>
Don't check previous flag to save all user-named functions in database<br>
 </li>
<li>Don's save/restore structures - do not save any extra info. Recommended for
standard complex structures, like IRP or something like.
 </li>
<li>Force load - by default, if function already have user-name, it will be
skipped at load stage. To force loading - set this flag.
 </li>
</ul>

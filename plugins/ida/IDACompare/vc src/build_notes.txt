
Build settings you will probably have to alter
in VC6 workspace 

Project->settings-> (select debug/release/all configuration)

C/C++ tab -> preprocessor drop down catagory -> additional include directories
link tab -> output file path
link tab -> object/library modules -> path to ida.lib

this project was originally built from ./idasdk/plugins/vc src

made some alterations to the code so it would compile under 4.8 api
thanks to those who forwarded the info.

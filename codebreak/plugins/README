Version 0.1.0 Initial Release.  Blackhat 2008.

 	
BUILDING THE PLUGIN

The IDA Pro plugin requires the IDA Pro SDK, which is distributed along with
Pro.  You need the version of the SDK that matches the version of IDA with 
which you indent to use the plugin.

First you need to unpack the archive, you may wish to do this directly into
a subdirectory of the SDK's plugins directory:

tar -zxf collabreate.tgz

Compiled binary plugins for IDA 4.9freeware, IDA5.0, IDA5.1, and IDA5.2 may
be found in the collabreate/bin directory.

The provided Makefile has an "IDA" variable which needs to point to the SDK
directory.  If you have unpacked collabreate into 
<SDKDIR>/plugins/collabreate, the default make file settings should work.

make -f Makefile

Or you may wish to use make's -e option to specify override the makefile's
IDA with one from the system:

IDA=../path/to/the/sdk
export IDA
make -e -f Makefile

Upon successfull compilation, the plugin collabreate.plw will be located in 
the <SDKDIR>/bin/plugins subdirectory of the SDK you built with (so it's 
relative to the IDA variable)

The provided Makefile has been tested most with Cygwin (requires make and gcc)
A Visual Studio .sln and .vcproj file are also provided



INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

As with any IDA plugin, simply copy the .plw file into IDA's plugins directory
which is probably something like C:\Program Files\IDA\plugins\

Due to Windows' file locking, you will likely need to make sure IDA is closed
before copying to this directory.



USING THE PLUGIN

It is intended that a new collabreation session is used for each binary loaded
into IDA Pro.  Once a binary is loaded and the autoanalysis phase has completed
you can activate CollabREate by pressing the hotkey ATL-F6 (which you can change
in plugins.cfg if you need to)

Upon activation you will be presented with a series of screens prompting you to 
connect to a CollabREate server, authenticate, start a new project, etc.  The 
exact series of steps will very upon the running mode of the server (such as if
it is connected to a backend database or not).

Typical Project Join Actions:
 Connect:           Connects to a collabreate server (default port is 5042)
 Authenticate:      Provide a User / Password to connect to the server
 Choose Project:    Provides a list of 'related' projects (1)
  New Project:      Request that the server creates a new project (2)
  Existing Project: Join an existing project
  Project Snapshot: Request a new project that is a Fork of an existing project
                    at a particular, previously saved point (2)

(1) only projects that match the MD5 of the binary loaded in IDA are displayed
(2) when starting a new project you must provide a textual description

When connecting to an existing project for the first time, you automatically
recieve all updates that have been made to the project prior to you joining.
On subsequent connections you will automatically receive any updates that have
been made since the last time you were connected to the project.

Once connected to a project, you can use IDA normally.  Updates you make are
sent to the server, updates other collabreators make are reflected in your
database.  The types of updates you can make depend on the version of IDA you
are using, basically 5.1 and higher have the most functionality (see table 1) 
for more information.

* An updated IDA 5.2 kernel is required in order for full structure updates
to be properly published.


Pressing Alt-F6 after the plugin is already activated will bring up a menu of 
collabreate specific commands.

Collabreation Actions:
 Disconnect:        Disconnect from the server.
 Fork:              Immediatly fork the project with the updates that IDA has
                    recieved and join this new project. (3)
 Snapshot:          Save a snapshot (point in time) (3)
 Manage Req Perms:  Allows the user to change the permissions requested when 
                    joining the project
 Manage Proj Perms: Allows the user (only if the user is the owner of the 
                    project) to alter the project permissions.

(3) the user must provide a textual desription

Forking creates a new projet that can have further updates, and that others can
participate in (join).  Snapshots are simply 'projects at a point in time' - not
actual projects.  You can not 'join' a snapshot.  You must fork a new project
from a snapshot.  Overall, snapshots take up much less space than forked 
projects.


If the server is connected to a database backend, a unique project id is stored
in the idb file and subsequent connections to a server will automatically 
connect to the correct project.

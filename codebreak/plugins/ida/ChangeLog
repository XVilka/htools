* 04/04/10
  Project renamed to "Code Break"

* 02/28/09
  Fixed buffer overflow problem pointed out by Jeremy Cooper

* 08/27/08
  Added local tracking of enum names to allow renaming of enums to work.
  Added more tests to narrow down the exact type being referenced when
  an operand type is changed.  Specifically enum and structure offsets.
  These changes will not fix enum and struct updates in existing project
  databases, however new enum and struct updates will be properly stored
  into those databases once you have upgraded you plugin.

  Fix to allow proper publishing of name changes that take place in the 
  .bss section

* 08/16/08
